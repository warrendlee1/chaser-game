# Chaser Game

https://warrendlee1.github.io/chaser-game/

Bobby the Bubble is running from enemy bubbles who are composed of poisonous chemicals that can pop him if he is exposed to too many of them. He must dodge the enemy bubbles in order to reach the window on the opposite side of the room and fly out to freedom where he can get some fresh air and reconnect with his family.

Using the arrow keys, help Bobby the Bubble reach the red window on the right of the screen.
Use the spacebar to slow down the enemy bubbles to help Bobby reach the other side.
Click the mouse to spawn a fake Bobby up to three times to distract enemy bubbles.

Good luck, and be careful!
